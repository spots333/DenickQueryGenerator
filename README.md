/denick command generator for my Duels Denicker bot.
To use:
After building/downloading, place it in its own folder for simplicity and run it. Currently it works for at least Lunar and BLC.
When giving it the file path, make sure to give it the file path, not a file, so something like this if you are using Lunar: "C:\Users\YourUser\\.lunarclient\offline\multiver\logs\"
spotsDenickerLogFile.txt file stores your log file paths.
You can run it before and after games. It generates the queries regardless.
